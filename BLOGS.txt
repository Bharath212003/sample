 HTTP/1.1 VS HTTP/2

In the world of web development, efficient communication between clients and servers is crucial. HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) plays a vital role in this communication. Over time, HTTP has evolved, leading to the introduction of HTTP/2, which brought significant improvements over HTTP/1.1. Let’s explore the key differences between the two protocols.

### 1. **Multiplexing**
- **HTTP/1.1**: Each request/response pair requires its own connection. This often leads to latency issues due to the “head-of-line blocking” problem, where one slow response can block others.
- **HTTP/2**: Supports multiplexing, allowing multiple requests and responses to share a single connection simultaneously, reducing latency and improving performance.

### 2. **Header Compression**
- **HTTP/1.1**: Headers are sent as plain text, leading to redundant data transfer and increased bandwidth usage, especially for repetitive requests.
- **HTTP/2**: Uses HPACK, a header compression algorithm, to minimize overhead and improve efficiency.

### 3. **Binary Protocol**
- **HTTP/1.1**: Operates as a text-based protocol, which can be slower and more error-prone due to the need for parsing.
- **HTTP/2**: Introduced a binary framing layer, making communication faster and more reliable.

### 4. **Server Push**
- **HTTP/1.1**: Relies on clients to explicitly request resources, which can result in delays.
- **HTTP/2**: Enables server push, allowing servers to proactively send resources to clients before they are requested, improving load times.

### 5. **Connection Management**
- **HTTP/1.1**: Requires multiple TCP connections for concurrent requests, which can lead to congestion and inefficiency.
- **HTTP/2**: Utilizes a single TCP connection for all requests, reducing overhead and improving resource utilization.

### Conclusion
HTTP/2 represents a significant advancement over HTTP/1.1, with improvements in speed, efficiency, and overall performance. By adopting HTTP/2, websites can deliver faster and more reliable user experiences, making it a vital tool for modern web development.

**Blog: Objects and Their Internal Representation in JavaScript**

JavaScript is a versatile language, and at its core, it relies heavily on objects. Understanding how objects work and their internal representation can provide deeper insights into writing efficient and optimized code.

### 1. **What Is an Object in JavaScript?**
An object is a collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or Symbols) and values can be any data type, including other objects or functions.

Example:
```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  greet: function() {
    console.log("Hello!");
  }
};
```

### 2. **Internal Representation**
JavaScript engines like V8 (used in Chrome and Node.js) optimize object storage and access through techniques like:

- **Hidden Classes**: When objects are created, the engine generates hidden classes to track their structure. Adding or removing properties dynamically can create new hidden classes, which may affect performance.
- **Property Access**: Properties are stored in a hash table or a similar structure for fast retrieval. Accessing properties is faster if the object’s structure remains consistent.

### 3. **Prototype Chain**
Every JavaScript object has an internal link to another object called its prototype. This chain is used to look up properties and methods that are not directly found on the object.

Example:
```javascript
const obj = {};
console.log(obj.toString); // Found on Object.prototype
```

### 4. **Special Object Types**
- **Arrays**: Specialized objects optimized for numerical indices.
- **Functions**: Objects with additional properties like `prototype` and callable behavior.
- **Dates and Regular Expressions**: Built-in objects with predefined methods and behaviors.

### 5. **Best Practices**
- Avoid adding or removing properties dynamically.
- Use `Object.create(null)` for objects without prototypes to avoid unnecessary lookups.
- Leverage `Object.freeze()` or `Object.seal()` to make objects immutable for specific use cases.

### Conclusion
Understanding JavaScript objects and their internal mechanisms enables developers to write more efficient code. By being mindful of object creation and manipulation, you can take full advantage of JavaScript’s performance capabilities.

**Understanding IP Addresses, Ports, HTTP Methods, and MAC Addresses**

1. **IP Address**:
   - A numerical label assigned to devices on a network for identification and communication.
   - Types: IPv4 (e.g., 192.168.1.1) and IPv6 (e.g., 2001:0db8::1).

2. **Port**:
   - A virtual endpoint for communication between devices.
   - Common ports: 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 22 (SSH).

3. **HTTP Methods**:
   - Used to define actions in web communication.
   - Examples:
     - `GET`: Retrieve data.
     - `POST`: Submit data.
     - `PUT`: Update data.
     - `DELETE`: Remove data.

4. **MAC Address**:
   - A unique identifier assigned to a device’s network interface card (NIC).
   - Format: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E.
